// "Choose an asset" requests, from a field to the Assets panel.
//
// The fields that ask (src, poster, an attribute value) sit several levels
// down inside the props panel, and the panel that answers lives in a
// different branch of the tree entirely — so the request travels through a
// module rather than being threaded as props through every field in between.
// Only one request can be open at a time, which is what makes that safe.

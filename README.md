# Stacki

Visual Builder for Astro.

A Mac & Windows desktop app for editing [Astro](https://astro.build) projects visually.

MIT licensed — fork it, build on it, ship your own version.

## Features

- **Pages** — browse every page in `src/pages`, create new pages (including nested routes like `blog/post-1`), and delete pages.
- **Layouts** — choose which layout from `src/layouts` wraps each page, and edit the layout's props (e.g. `title`).
- **Components** — every component in `src/components` appears in the palette. Drag one into the page structure (or double-click to append), drag to reorder, click ✕ to remove.
- **Props** — the props panel reads each component's `interface Props` / `Astro.props` destructure and generates typed fields (text, number, checkbox). Defaults are shown as placeholders.
- **Live preview** — the app runs `astro dev` for the opened project and embeds it. Edits are auto-saved (300 ms debounce), so Astro's hot reload updates the preview as you type.
- **Git & GitHub** — the branch chip in the title bar shows the current branch and dirty state. From its dropdown you can switch branches, create branches, commit, push, or publish a brand-new repo to GitHub (via the `gh` CLI).
- **Embedded terminal** — open a real project-root shell inside Stacki from the left rail or with `⌥T`. The 480px panel is resizable, and hiding it keeps the running CLI and scrollback alive.
- **Code fallback** — pages with markup too complex for the visual model open in a code editor instead, still with live preview.
- **New project** — "New Project…" scaffolds a minimal Astro starter (layout + 5 components + home page) and runs `npm install` for you.

## Running in development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts Vite (renderer hot reload) and launches Electron against it.

The embedded terminal uses the native `node-pty` module. `npm install` runs
electron-builder's dependency rebuild so the module targets Stacki's Electron
version rather than the system Node.js version.

To run against a production build of the UI:

```bash
npm start
```

## Packaging installers

If you're building for yourself or from a fork, use the unsigned build — it
needs no Apple Developer account and no certificates:

```bash
npm run dist:mac:unsigned   # .dmg + .zip, no signing (build on macOS)
npm run dist:win            # NSIS installer (build on Windows)
```

Output lands in `release/`. macOS will warn the first time you open an
unsigned build; right-click the app and choose Open to get past Gatekeeper.

The signed variants are for maintainers with the release certificates:

```bash
npm run dist:mac   # requires a Developer ID cert + notarization credentials
```

## Releases

Official builds are published by CI, not from anyone's laptop. Pushing a
`v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds a signed and
notarized macOS universal build plus a Windows installer, uploads them to
the `stacki-releases` repo, and only makes the release visible once both
platforms have landed. Shipped apps auto-update from that feed via
`electron-updater`.

Signing and notarization credentials live in GitHub Actions secrets. They
are never in this repository, and GitHub does not expose them to workflows
triggered from forks — so a fork can build and run everything here, but
cannot produce a build signed with the official identity. That's intended.

If you fork this and publish your own builds, change `build.appId` and
`build.publish` in `package.json` to your own identifiers so your releases
don't collide with the official update feed.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. A few notes:

- `npm run dev` is all you need for day-to-day work — no credentials required.
- Please don't add workflows that use `pull_request_target`, or any workflow
  that exposes secrets to code from a fork.
- Report security issues privately to the maintainer rather than opening a
  public issue.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ and npm (the app shells out to `npm install` / `astro dev` for opened projects)
- `git` for version control features
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`), authenticated via `gh auth login`, for "Publish to GitHub"

## How editing works

Pages are parsed into a simple model: optional layout wrapper + a flat list of
self-closing component instances with props. The editor writes that model back
as clean `.astro` source. Pages containing arbitrary HTML, expressions, or
nested children fall back to the built-in code editor — nothing is ever
rewritten destructively.
